Frontend editor notes
- Hidden in file list: agpeya/, bible/, readings/, images.json, explanations.json.
- Holy Week editor: service/hour/section dropdowns; sticky header (summary/submit/diff); tables bar sticky with hamburger toggle on scroll. Table cards with editable fields; placeholders for repeated_prayer; row-class dropdown; add/remove row above/below; add/remove cell fields; min 1 language per cell; delete row uses trash icon.
- Holy Week diff: shows English title above each change; section headers placed with their change (clickable tags); diff collapsible.
- Base-schema files (non–Holy Week): reuse Holy Week-style table cards. Category files (seasonalPraises, repeated prayers seasonal variants) show a category dropdown then tables; base-table files render tables directly; row-only files (endOfServiceParts, psalm150Refrains) use a simple row editor.
- Base optional fields supported: coptic_title, arabic_title, title, nonTraditionalPascha, postFirstCanticleNonSunday, theotokiasIndex, defaultVisibility, explanation_button, image_button, caption_class, themes, seasons, excludedSeasons, placement, saints, service, table_class, dayOfTheWeek, weekdayWeekend, category, aktonkAki. Booleans as checkboxes; arrays as chip inputs with add/remove; strings as inputs.
- Placeholders: repeated_prayer_title/source/category (+ repeated_prayer_variables season, passToTable.dayOfTheWeek); repeated_prayer_placement/source/category (+ passToTable.dayOfTheWeek); link-only.
- Row-class dropdown uses enum: Intro, Refrain, commentary, congregation, intro, navigationButton, navigationLink, north, priest, refrain, silent-prayer, south, text.
- Base tables: tbodies have “+ tbody above” per tbody, “+ tbody below” at end, and black background for tbody sections. Rows keep add above/below, delete (trash), cell add/remove.
- Row-only files: row editor with optional array fields as chips (e.g., seasons), row-class dropdown, add/remove rows and cell fields.
- Deploy (Windows): `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File json-editor/scripts/deploy_frontend.ps1 -Bucket liturgicalbooks-editor-ui -Profile liturgicalbooks -DistributionId E3U8PRC9BR5M03`
- App refactor: editor split into components (`components/LoginForm`, `FileList`, `PendingChanges`, `DiffPanel`, `HolyWeekEditor`, `BaseTableEditor`, `RowOnlyEditor`) with shared constants in `src/editorConfig.js`; behavior unchanged.
