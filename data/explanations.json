          "text": "The 3rd Hos is the praise of the whole creation led by the church. It is the praise said by The Three Saintly Children in the furnace. When we all chant it in the church, we are symbolizing the world with all its bitterness and temptations, yet we are preserved by the Son of God (Dan. 3:25). The fire of the world (Satan) has no authority on us. The church has tasted the love and mercy of its Groom, so it is calling everyone to share in praising and glorifying Him.\nThe church has gained its authority over all the creation through the authority given by God. As it is living in the Divine Paradise here on earth, it is inviting the whole creation to praise God \"exceedingly to be praised and exalted above all, forever\", as an announcement for the new heaven.\nThe 1st and 2nd Hos both express the victory of the children of God over their enemies, through God’s strong and outstretched arm. However, the 3rd Hos expresses the victory of man over his pains and temptations. In this case, he accepts these tribulations gracefully, as if they are a gift from God’s hand, \"For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\" (Phil. 1:29)\nAs the fire did not burn the three young saints, in the same way, the fire of Hades did not burn the righteous ones. Instead, the fire burnt the devil’s followers, and it is written in the Holy Bible, \"Look!\" he answered, \"I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" (Dan.3: 25)"

          "title": "Background of the Hymn Tenen",
          "text": "Primarily chanted in the month of Kiahk and Joyous Saturday, the hymn, Tenen has a wonderful tune and meaning. It calls the prayers and praises a \"mental worship and sacrifice\". In addition, it honors the three saints (Hanania Azariah and Mishael) who deserved the Son of Man to walk with them amidst the fire and protect them. This hymn demonstrates the work of God with the three young men (also known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) when he saved them from the furnace.\n\"And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king's counsellors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them.\" (Dan. 3:27) This story in its entirety is recorded in the book of Daniel chapter 1-3. Moreover, the hymn urges us to offer thanksgiving after partaking of the Holy Communion, thus we gain the full blessings of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The disciples and Jesus gave us the example to follow, as it is written, \"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives\" (Matt. 26:30). It is of significant note, the timing of when the hymn is chanted, after the 3rd Hos and proceeding the hymn (\"Tenoih we follow You with all our hearts\") and then the congregation of the saints."

          "title": "Composition of Tenen",
          "text": "The Hymn Tenen, known as the Hymn for the Three Saintly Children, is composed of four parts. The first two parts are in Greek and the latter two are in Coptic. Each part is concluded with the phrase \"Hanania Azariah and Mishael.\" The conclusion of the hymn is the concluding phrase \"Praising and blessing God at all times.\"\nThe hymn is first recorded in the Kiahk psalmody in 1781 AD while not being recorded in the annual psalmody published by the same publisher in 1804 AD which leads us to believe that the hymn originally was intended for the month of Kiahk. A study of the hymn and its spiritual meaning concluded that the hymn can be chanted at any time as its meaning is not specific to Kiahk but rather a hymn praising the three young men and urging us to praise at all times. It is however reserved for the month of Kiahk as there is more time during the 7 & 4 praise permitting us to chant the hymn. This does not preclude the believer from chanting it during the annual midnight praise if there is time.\nThe \"Dallal of Holy Week\" or \"Instructions on the rites of Holy Week\" instructs the believers to chant this hymn during the vigil of Bright Saturday. The concluding phrase of the hymn which says \"Praising and blessing God at all times\" urges us to chant it at all times and thus we participate with the three young men in praising God always."

He did not prevent the fire, nor did he remove its heat and the proof is that those who put them in the furnace were burned. Instead, He protected them from the fire and from being burned. This is a very wondrous event and that is why we remember it always and praise God for it particularly because this story occurs every day with each one of us..."

          "title": "Introduction to Psali Prayers",
          "text": "The praise \"My Heart and My Tongue\" (or \"Apahyt nem palac\") is a Psali Adam for the second Canticle (Hos), and is chanted during the 7&4 praises in the month of Kiahk. The word \"Psali\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"a chant,\" and is a group of poetic verses used to praise the Lord, St. Mary, or any of the martyrs or saints.\nA Psali is often arranged in alphabetical order, with each verse starting with the subsequent letter of the Coptic alphabet. There are 3 Psali tunes for the different seasons (Annual, Kiahk, or Festive) and in each season, there are two unique tunes (Adam or Watos). Adam tunes are to be chanted during Adam days (Sunday – Tuesday), while Watos tunes are chanted during Watos days (Wednesday – Saturday).\nThe \"My Heart and My Tongue\" Psali is chanted before the second Canticle (Hos). Its purpose, like most of the praises chanted during Kiahk, is to help the worshipper contemplate the theme of the upcoming hymn or praise. In this instance, the fathers wanted the worshiper to prepare his or her heart and remind him/her that true prayer first must come from the heart.\nLet us first contemplate the theme of the second Canticle so that we may better understand the purpose of its preceding Kiahk Psali, \"My Heart and My Tongue.\""

          "title": "The Second Canticle",
          "text": "The words of this Canticle are taken from Psalm 135. It is a praise of thanksgiving offered by the church to God for His everlasting Goodness and Mercy. It is offered by the children of Israel, thanking God for releasing them from Egypt, sustaining them in the wilderness, protecting them, and allowing them to enter the Promised Land.\nThe phrase \"Alleluia, His mercy endures forever\" repeats 28 times at the end of each verse. Alleluia means \"rejoice for God,\" and represents the happiness, rejoice and thanksgiving to God, whose mercy endures forever. The repetition (and the Holy Spirit never repeats in vain) denotes that God’s mercy prevailed over all generations: from King David the Prophet and Psalmist, until the coming of Christ. St. Matthew affirms this when he writes: \"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.\" (Matt. 1.17)\nPsalm 135 starts by thanking God, and then presents examples of God’s mercy and support for His children. Elsewhere in the Psalms, King David writes \"The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.\" (Ps. 145:18). Here, he assures that we should pray and offer thanksgiving to God, the Good Lord of lords, always, and that we are not worthy of all His mercies poured upon us. God is kind and good, from the beginning until the end; this should be our prayer and meditation through our whole life. It is the secret of life, where we continuously discover His goodness and kindness, and praise Him with \"Alleluia, His mercy endures forever.\""

          "title": "Contemplation on \"My Heart and My Tongue\"",
          "text": "**The Refrain:**\nThis Psali begins by explaining something very important, which is that praise starts with the heart and not the tongue. This phrase repeats multiple times as a refrain of the praise.\nThis is why the praise begins with \"my heart\" (\"Apahyt\" in Coptic), and then \"my tongue\" (\"nem palas\"). Our praise is to start from the heart and then go to the tongue.\n\"Praise the trinity\" (\"Hos eti etrias\") is the next part of the refrain. When one is engulfed in these spiritual feelings, and truly praises, he or she will see that the heart is not yet completely in praise.\nThe verse continues with, \"O Holy Trinity have mercy on us\" (\"Agia etrias eleyson eemas\"). Here the worshipper seeks God’s mercy, knowing that one should be completely engulfed in praise. However, when one finds his or heart not yet at this level, he or she seeks God’s mercy to remove the things that deter this level of praise.\nWe find that when an individual focuses on the life of praise which comes from the heart, he or she will start their growth in a spiritual life with God. This Psali provides us with an education in praise, beginning with supplications and developing into spiritual presence with God.\""

          "title": "",
          "text": "**Additional verses:**\nThis journey in praise can be seen by contemplating the remaining verses of the Psali:\nAfter chanting the refrain, the worshiper begins to look around him and realizes that the heavenly and earthly are offering a higher deeper praise to God. He realizes that his praise is not completely from the heart so he looks to God and says \"everyone praises You and worships.\"\nRealizing his/her shortcomings, the worshiper begins to contemplate saying \"For You are our God and great Savior\" because God is the Great and no one is greater. Because He is our savior, all praise is due to Him.\n\"The Master Lord came and saved us\" - during this Advent season, we are engulfed with the coming and incarnation of God to save us, and so we thank and praise Him. Without His coming, our destiny would be eternal death; therefore, it is fitting that we praise Him.\n\"For the sake of your true commandments, teach me Your justice\" – here we remember what happened with Adam and God’s love for us; He who came and carried Adam’s sin onto the Cross to grant us forgiveness from sin.\nThis is why, in the next verse we chant, \"Many are Your mercies.\" We see God, who with this mercy, emptied Himself, accepted suffering and, died on the Cross. Truly Your mercies, Lord, are too much. \"Grant us Your salvation\"\n\"I took refuge in You\" – I am unable to be complete before You, therefore I seek You and take refuge in You. I put myself before You. The original Coptic translation here implies a very fervent desire of the believer quickly rushing to take refuge in God.\"\n\"Yours is the power and glory, O King of glory\" – despite being born in a manger among animals, He is the King of glory. Likewise, in Holy Week, we see His suffering on the Cross, but he conquers death as the victorious Lord. Truly you, Lord, emptied yourself, born of a poor girl in a lowly place, yet Yours is the glory. Truly despite your humility, You are the King of Glory.\n\"Jesus is our hope, in our tribulations\" – no one else can help us.\nPraise is higher than normal prayers. Through it we do not seek anything physical or financial, but rather things much deeper. We are more concerned with the spiritual and with thanksgiving and glorification. Therefore, we say, \"You are blessed O Son of God, deliver us from temptation,\" as the chanter is entrenched between two thoughts – \"praise\" and \"deliverance from temptations.\"\n\"All nations praise You O Christ the King\" – anyone praising often contemplates the heavens and the earthly and how they too are praising God.\nThen we ask for another spiritual supplication – \"Grant us Your peace, heal our sicknesses.\" Here, sickness is not only referring to physical illnesses, but also the spiritual ones.\n\"You are the compassionate, and the Merciful\" – no one else can show us mercy like You.\n\"You are blessed, we praise and bless You\" – again we are entrenched between these two thoughts, praise, and spiritual supplications.\n\"Truly great is the Just judge\" – here, we see how God seeks justice for His children, and saves them as he did with the children of Israel. Truly, He is patient, yet also just.\n\"Your Name is blessed O the True Logos\" – perhaps if we were only reliant on ourselves in prayer without the help of the words of the fathers, we might forget to praise God and magnify His name. However, when we use praises and words of the Father, it makes up for our shortcomings. We then use praise and spiritual supplications to account for anything that we might forget.\n\"Guard us O Christ, with Your Goodness\" – we are confident that God is watching over us, yet we ask it again.\nThe spiritual person asks for himself or herself, and while engulfed and sanctified in prayer, he or she begins to imagine others praising God. Simultaneously, one contemplates those who are deprived from this praise, and longs for everyone to join in praise; therefore, he or she asks \"Hearken unto the sinners in their tribulations\" – asking God to help everyone with their troubles.\nAs we start by saying My heart and My tongue, now we say \"My soul and my mind\" for we want the whole being to praise God. We continue with \"Raise them up to heaven\" because we yearn to lead a true spiritual life, as a stranger to earth, and long for the true dwelling in heaven.\n\"O Son of our God, grant us Your salvation\" – another spiritual supplication.\n\"God the merciful, the long suffering\" – This is another request for mercy and reaffirms our asking for the same in every verse in the refrain.\n\"Holy, Holy, Holy, O Son of the Holy\" – offering praise and sanctification to God.\n\"The souls of our fathers, give rest to them O Savior\" – This reminds us not to forget those before us. We also ask mercy for those who have reposed.\n\"O our Master remember us, in Your heavenly kingdom\" – We long to return to our true dwelling and ask God to remember us in heaven for when we may return."

          "text": "During the month of Kiahk, the whole church lives in a state of preparedness so that we may be ready to receive the Incarnate Son of God. The most prominent sign of the Divine Incarnation in the Old Testament was the appearance of the Lord to Moses, the arch-prophet, on the Mountain of God, Sinai. The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in the middle of a bush.  Moses fasted forty days in preparation to receive the two tablets of the Testimony, written with the finger of God. Therefore, we fast the same period, in preparation to receive the Incarnate Word of God. We stay up during the night in worship, raising praises to the Lord, giving thanks, and glorifying God in a state of joy. The Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, expresses the spiritual feelings of the human soul when she lives in the heaven of God, frees herself from the ties of the language, and unites with the Lord.\nWhen David the Prophet said, \"Seven times a day I praise You for Your righteous ordinances\" (Psalm 119:164), he clarified that seven is a complete number. In the same way, the Church organized the Canonical hours, or the Seven-hour prayers, to be prayed all day long. The rite that characterizes the Coptic month of Kiahk emphasizes this fact. This rite is known as \"Seven and Four.\" It highlights seven hymns (Theotokias) for glorifying the Mother of God, the Theotokos. "

They are divided into two main groups, \"Adam\" and \"Watos\" (Coptic word for \"bush\"), according to the beginning of the Monday Theotokia, and Thursday Theotokia respectively:\n-The first hymn is: \"While Adam was sad, the Lord was pleased, to restore him again, to his authority.\"\n-The second hymn is: \"The bush which Moses, has seen in the wilderness, and the fire that was in it, did not burn its branches.\"\nThe first type of melody has a special tone and is devoted for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday (Adam days). The second type is characterized by its long tone and is chanted on the other days of the week (Watos days).\nThere are several hymns that are chanted with these two melodies.

All the Theotokias have a common goal: to explain the Orthodox dogma, and faith of the mystery of redemption: God becoming Man in order to save us.\nThe Thursday Theotokia and its explanation \"The Burning Bush\" marvels at the Incarnation.  The refrain of the Thursday Theotokia is \"He did not cease to be Divine, He came and became the Son of Man, for He is the True God, who came and saved us.\"  The burning bush is a prophesy of the Incarnation of God and how His Divinity did not part from His Humanity for a single moment. Therefore, this melody is perfectly suited to explain the Thursday Theotokia and teach us about the Divinity of Christ and His Incarnation. \nThe first Coptic word of the Thursday Theotokia is Pibatoc which translates to \"the bush\".  The words of the first part of the Thursday Theotokia explain how the burning bush is a symbol of St. Mary:\n-The bush which Moses, has seen in the wilderness, and the fire that was in it, did not burn its branches.\n-This is a symbol of Mary, the undefiled Virgin, which the Word of the Father, came and took flesh from her.\n-The fire of His divinity, did not burn the womb of the Virgin, and after she bore Him, she remained a virgin.\nCompare the words of the Theotokia, with those of the refrain of the burning bush:\n-The burning bush seen by Moses, the prophet in the wilderness, the Fire inside it was aflame, but never consumed nor injured it.\n-The same with the Theotokos Mary, carried the Fire of Divinity, nine months in her holy body, without blemishing her virginity.\n-In the following 8 parts of the Thursday Theotokia, we declare our pride, honor, amazement, and the impact of St. Mary on humanity:\n>>Part 2: The pride of all virgins...\n>>Part 3: Which mind ... or speech or sound can attain the unterrable expression...\n>>Part 4: Oh what an honor to the conception...\n>>Part 5: Oh what mysterious contractions...\n>>Part 6: Oh what a great wonder...\n>>Part 7: Oh what are these symphonies...\n>>Part 8: He bowed the heaven of heavens, and came to the womb...\n>>Part 9: I saw a miracle..., let us glorify the Virgin..., The new heaven on earth...\nSimilarly, in the burning bush, many stanzas end with the refrain \"blessed is the pride of the human race\".\nThe melody of the burning bush contemplates and expands on many of these marvels that the Thursday Theotokia teaches us – about St. Mary and her life-giving birth to our Savior."

          "title": "Theological Significance of the Burning Bush",
          "text": "The burning bush caught Moses’ attention.  How can such a small bush, be on fire, yet not burn? It was a surprising, wonderful scene.   Exodus 3:3-4 states \"Then Moses said, \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn. So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, \"Moses, Moses!\"\" \nThen God commanded him to take off his shoes, as the ground he was standing on was blessed by the descent of God onto the bush.  It was one of the first instances of God \"descending\" somewhere.  The passage explains that, from the burning bush, an Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in flaming fire, all while the bush was not consumed. When Moses tried to approach the Angel of the Lord in the burning bush, a change happens in the text: He is no longer called the \"Angel of the Lord,\" but rather, simply, \"the Lord.\" In this passage, therefore, we learn that the Angel of the Lord in the burning bush is the Lord Himself.\nBut isn’t this confusing? Why would Moses identify Him as the \"Angel of the Lord\" initially and then switch to simply \"the Lord\" only a couple of sentences later?\nThe answer is beautiful and awe-inspiring.\nThe word \"angel\" (ἄγγελος) simply means \"messenger,\" one who is sent by God. We are familiar with the multitudes of holy angels who have ministered for our salvation throughout human history. These are the luminous and spiritual beings like the Cherubim, and Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and many others. What we are oftentimes unfamiliar with is that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is called an Angel or Messenger in the Holy Scripture, most notably in Book of Isaiah:\nFor a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him (Is 9:6).\nWhen Moses beheld the Angel of the Lord as flaming fire in the burning bush, he beheld none other than the Preincarnate Christ – Who is the Messenger, sent by God, while being of one Essence with God, as we say about Him in the Nicaean-Constantinopolitan Creed, \"Light of Light; True God of True God; begotten, not created; of one Essence with the Father.\"\nThis reality becomes especially clear when we consider how the Holy Scripture speaks of Moses as one who spoke to the Lord face to face as with a friend (Ex. 33:11, 34:10). Indeed, Moses asked the Lord with all boldness, \"Manifest Thyself to me\" and the Lord granted his request:\nSo the Lord said to Moses, \"I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.\" And he said, \"Please, show me Your glory.\" Then He said, \"I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\" But He said, \"You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.\" And the Lord said, \"Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock. So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by.  Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen (Ex 33:17–23).\nBehold, what graciousness! What love! What humility! The Lord of Hosts deigns to manifest Himself to His servant, Moses. But there is a seeming conflict here: why does the Holy Scripture say Moses conversed with God face to face if the Lord Himself said, \"My face shall not appear to thee?\" Also, didn’t our Lord Jesus Christ tell the Holy Apostle Peter, \"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father\" (Jn 6:46). What, then, did Moses see? The Holy Augustine answers this question:\nIt was [the Lord], therefore, under that aspect in which He willed to appear (but He did not appear in His own very nature) which Moses longed to see, inasmuch as that is promised to the saints in another life. Hence the answer made to Moses is true that no one can see the face of God and live; that is, no one living in this life can see Him as fully as He is. Many have seen, but they saw what His will chose, not what His nature formed … when He willed … not in His nature under which He lies hidden within Himself even when he is seen. \nAugustine thus teaches that Moses did in fact see a manifestation of God, the Angel of the Lord Who is the Preincarnate Christ, face to face, but he did not see the face of God in His Divine nature as He is, for no man can see that and live.\nThis great gift which the Lord conferred on Moses is given to every person who beholds the face of Christ, the \"Messenger of Great Counsel\" Who came to us in all humility and love. The Holy Apostle Paul spoke of Him as the \"Image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature\" (Col 1:15). As the Holy Cyril of Jerusalem preached in his Tenth Catechetical Lecture, \"Therefore, because no one could see the face of the Godhead and live, He assumed the face of human nature [in Christ], that seeing this we might live.\"  And, in case there is any doubt as to whether our Lord Jesus Christ is God, of one Essence with the Father and the Holy Spirit, we recall the awesome scene on Mount Tabor when He \"was transfigured before them: and His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light\" (Mt 17:2). It is no coincidence that, when His face radiated as the sun so that no man could bear to look at it, Moses himself was present as an experienced witness to the glory of God in Christ.\nLike Moses, we behold the face of Christ through purity of life and zeal in Christian living. The Holy Basil the Great teaches us in his Long Rule 16:\nThe whole life of the saints and of the blessed, the example of the Lord Himself while He was with us in the flesh, are aids to us in this matter. Moses, through long perseverance in fasting and prayer, received the law and heard the words of God, ‘as a man is wont to speak to his friend,’ says the Scripture. \nThus, when we sing about the burning bush that Moses beheld in the wilderness during the Holy Month of Kiahk, we remember the Angel of the Lord Who appeared in the flames of fire, the Preincarnate Christ Who in all graciousness, love, and humility manifested Himself to Moses just as He continually manifests Himself to all of us who strive to behold His face in our lives."

          "text": "When we worship God, we say \"we worship you O Christ, with your Good Father and the Holy Spirit for You have come and saved us.\"  We know the True God, we know that He came to us, and is abiding with us; \"Emmanuel\".  The incarnation of the Son of God is symbolized in the Praxis reading of the Second Sunday of Kiahk.  As the Fire of Divinity dwelt in St. Mary without consuming or burning her, so did the Fire of Divinity dwell in the bush which Moses saw.  \nThe Burning Bush has 6 meanings:\n1. Symbolic meaning: St. Mary as the burning Bush – the fire of His Divinity did not consume the womb of the Virgin.\n2. Historical meaning: The circumstances around Moses’ vision: the Israelites in Egypt were under oppression.  They cried to God and in response to this cry, God appeared to Moses in the burning bush.  It’s as if God is saying, if the fire is the oppression, and my people are the bush, as long as I am in the midst of the bush, the fire will not consume the people, and I will deliver them from Egypt with a mighty hand.  \n3. Prophetic meaning: The oppression of the Israelites in Egypt symbolizes the oppression of humans to Satan.  The people cried for so many years since Adam and Eve, and could not be redeemed from their sins, as they were under the oppression of Satan.  This is why we hear in the Pauline on the second Sunday of Kiahk to the Romans, \"there is none righteous, no not one, there is none who understand, there is none who seek God…there is none that does good, no not one\".  St. Paul concludes in Chapter 3 that we need a Savior.  God saw our oppression under Satan, and the cry of His people for more than 5000 years and understood our suffering. So, He decided to come down from heaven to deliver us from the oppression of Satan – just as He delivered the Israelites from Egypt, to bring us to a better inheritance of the Kingdom of God.  The symbolism being: \n-Fire is as the oppression of Satan\n-The Bush is as the human race\nYet God dwelling with us (Emmanuel) delivers us from the fire of the oppression of Satan.\n4. Christological meaning: The burning bush symbolizes the unity between the Humanity and Divinity in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He is a perfect God and a perfect Human.  These natures are united together without mingling, confusion, or alteration.  These two natures are not separate but are united in a mysterious way.  How was the fire united with the bush?  The Bush was not consumed by the fire, and yet was not separate from it.  What a mystery! \nThis symbolizes the unity of the Humanity and Divinity in the Nature of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son, God the Logos.\n5. Spiritual meaning: The burning bush symbolizes us.  The fire symbolizes the consuming fire of God.  This fire did not consume the bush itself, but the fire consumes the thorns, and weeds around the bush.  It is a purifying fire.  In the same way Christ came, and is united with us to purify us, and to cleanse us from every sin.  The Catholic Epistle for the second Sunday of Kiahk mentions that \"if we walk in the light as He is in the Light… and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all our sins\" (1 John 1:7). \nWhen we see the union between the fire and the bush, it reminds us of the union between us and God in communion.  With this union, the consuming fire of God does not us, but rather it consumes our sins and makes us a new creation, and pure through the righteousness of Christ.\n6. Theological meaning: We read in the book of Songs \"for love is as strong as death. Its flames are flames of fire. A most vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench love, nor can the floods drown it.  If a man would give for love all the wealth of his house, it would be utterly despised\" (Song of Solomon 8:6).  The fire symbolizes the loving God.  This fire is the fire of love.  When we ask ourselves why God became man, and why He chose to save us, the answer is His love.  It’s a burning fire within Him; He could not help it but save us.  In the Monday Theotokia, we say \"Your love has forced you…\", this love made God plan for our salvation by coming down to save us.  When we see this burning bush, burning with fire, we can understand how much God loves us.  St. Paul talks about this love: \"He did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up on the Cross for our salvation\" (Romans 8:32).  That’s how much God loves us; He died on the Cross to save us."

          "text": "The word \"Psali\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"a chant,\" and is a group of poetic verses used to praise the Lord, St. Mary, or any of the martyrs or saints. \nA Psali is often arranged in alphabetical order, with each verse starting with the subsequent letter of the Coptic alphabet. There are 3 Psali tunes for the different seasons (Annual, Kiahk, or Festive) and in each season, there are two unique tunes (Adam or Watos). Adam tunes are to be chanted during Adam days (Sunday – Tuesday), while Watos tunes are chanted during Watos days (Wednesday – Saturday). \nThere are also Special Event Psalis, these include:\nPsalis for the Feasts of the Lord, the Feast of the Cross, the Feast of Nayrouz. These are chanted the festive tune.\nPsalis for the blessed month of Kiahk. These are chanted in special tunes for the month of Kiahk.\nPsalis for the Great Fast. These are chanted in the annual tune.\nPsalis for the celebrations of St. Mary, the angels, and Saints. These are chanted in the annual tune."

Examples of this are the Adam Psali for the feast of Nayrouz, and the Adam Psali for \"Your mercies oh my God\".  The same arrangement can be found in the conclusion of the Adam Theotokias adds 5 verses whose first letter spells the name of its author: Gabriel.

          "title": "The Name of Our Lord Jesus in the Psalis",
          "text": "Many of the Psalis focus on the repetition of the Name of Our Lord Jesus.  The words of many Psalis are derived from the Book of Psalms but are addressed to our Lord Jesus Christ.  Specifically, the daily annual Psalis are primarily short prayers and direct please to \"my Lord Jesus Christ\".  \nNote that throughout the communal prayers we often refer to the collective body of the Church.  For instance: \n-Verses of the commemoration of the saints end with \"that He may forgive us our sins\"\n-\"Have mercy upon us\" is the conclusion of many verses throughout the psalmody hymns\n-\"for You have come and saved us\" is another conclusion of many verses throughout the psalmody hymns\n-\"O Lord grant us the forgiveness of our sins\" is the conclusion of many verses of the Lobsh for each Hos.\nIn the Psalis however, we personally plea to Our Lord Jesus Christ: \"My Lord Jesus\" or \"My Lord Jesus Christ…\".  \nIt is also noteworthy to mention that the Church does not differentiate between our conversation with Our Lord Jesus Christ, and the calling upon His name.  Calling upon, praising, praying to His name, is equivalent to calling upon Him, praising Him, and praying to Him directly.  For example, in the conclusion of the Adam Daily Psalis we chant: \"and whenever we gather for prayer, let us bless the name of my Lord Jesus.  We bless you O my Lord Jesus, deliver us through Your name for we have hope in you. This is also evidenced by the Sunday and Saturday Psalis for the Lord where we chant: \"All of the souls together bless Your Name. My Lord Jesus help me\", and \"With delight we praise You, all of us Your People, O my Lord Jesus Christ, my good Savior.\"  Also, in the Sunday Psali we chant \"Create in me a clean heart…\", and in the Monday Psali we chant \"… and let us purify our hearts, in the name of my Lord\" and \"… the joy of our hearts is Your holy name, O my Lord Jesus.\"\nConversing with, and repeating, the name of the Lord Jesus with short, strong prayers is a Coptic, monastic tradition, first observed and established in the deserts of Egypt.  This tradition, observed by mostly illiterate monks, were a source of comfort, prayer, and blessing. It then spread to their laymen visitors and the rest of the world.  This tradition is sometimes referred to as the \"prayer of the heart\" or \"prayer of the arrow\".  It is through the repetition of the Lord’s name throughout the day that joy, peace, fulfillment, and gladness fill our heart, and rid us of any other desires.\nThe name of the Lord, as found in the Psalis, is a name glorified in His saints.  It is a source of victory over tribulations, and salvation from all our difficulties.  It is the food of life, which fulfills spiritual and physical needs.  The name of the Lord is alive in the mouths of the righteous; it purifies our hearts, and saves our souls, for it is the name of Salvation which enlightens our inner beings.  Through it our hearts are glad, our tongues rejoice, and our spirits receive joy.   The name of the Lord is the precious jewel which a person sells all that he or she has to obtain it.  The name of the Lord is full of glory; it is the fullness of all blessings. \nA person’s natural feeling always yearns to God who is the utmost perfection. One can never find rest in just prayers and asking things of God. To find rest, we should give, and we cannot feel that we are giving something adequate to God except by giving ourselves. \"Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.’\" (Heb. 10:5)\nPrayers and praising were made by God – through Jesus Christ – as an open gate for us to complete our love to Him, which we previously lost. \"Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name.\" (Heb. 13:15) "

So even while glorifying our lady the Theotokos, we are praying to our Lord Jesus Christ. "

          "title": "Contemplation on the Sunday Psali",
          "text": "***\"I sought after You, from the depth of my heart, My Lord Jesus help me.\"***\nThrough the praises of the Holy Psalmody, our souls progress along a spiritual journey. We ask God to deliver us, as He brought those out of the land of sin and slavery into the wilderness. After being saved, we give thanks to the One Who saves us from our miseries. Then, at the envy and rage of the devil, we are pressured by his deceptive ways, trying to lure us back into Egypt by offering us the materials of this world. If we fight him through prayer, he begins to torture us physically and spiritually, but if we resist and pray to God, then we shall be freed from these afflictions and the God of heaven will stand in our midst. We will then call on the saints to stand with us, uniting the Church with the heavens, learning from them, asking them to pray for us as we endure trials in this earth. We are then, through God’s abundant grace, brought into the chorus of the heavens, as we pray the Fourth Canticle with all the choirs of the heavens, praising our awesome and powerful God as He sits on His throne. \nWe then come to the Psalies in the Holy Psalmody. If we look at the words, we may notice a penitent approach in this hymn. How can one who stands in heaven show sorrow and remorse and ask for repentance? Although this seems contradicting, it is through the wisdom of the Fathers by the works of Holy Spirit that this beautiful hymn is put following the Fourth Canticle.\nWe begin the Sunday Psali for the Lord Jesus with this verse. This one verse can sum up the lives of the saints and why we honor them. How can we truly say to our Lord that we have sought Him from the depths of our hearts? Only a select few lived the life of Christianity, struggling with blood and sweat, confessing the Name of our Lord before the emperors, and showing their undying love for God. We can also take examples from the great fathers of the desert, such as St. Antony the Great. After hearing one command of the Lord (Mark 10:21) he journeyed into the wilderness, and because of his perfect zeal, he forsook all to follow the teachings of our Lord. We chant this first verse of the Psali so that He may sanctify our hearts and minds, so that we may follow Him as He said:\n\"If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" (Matthew 16:24)\nThe second part of the first verse of the Psali is even more important than the first part. We mentioned that this verse can sum up the lives of the saints. Although the saints led the life of Christianity, truly seeking Christ from the depths of their hearts, they always followed their zeal for Christ with the words, \"My Lord Jesus, help me.\" They realized that they did not attain the spiritual gifts of heaven by their own power, but that it was the God of Heaven who bestowed upon them these gifts through His grace. King Solomon alluded to this when he wrote:\n\"The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.\" (Proverbs 18:10)\nIn singing these words, we too beseech God to help us, calling on the Name of the Lord as we run towards this strong tower. We also ask Him to illuminate our hearts so that we may follow Him. Out of His love, He hears the pleas that we may make.\n\"Do not lose your hope, for God cares for your salvation more than you do. He is the One who seeks your salvation, and this has been His way from the start\" (H.H. Pope Shenouda III).\n\n***\"You are the Son of God, I believe in You, My Lord Jesus, help me. You who carries, the sins of the world save me, My Lord Jesus Christ, help me.\"***\nHow can we pray to our Lord if we do not recognize who He is? Why should we meditate on His Name if we do know His significance in our lives? This seemingly straightforward passage is essential in the prayer of the Sunday Psali of our Lord Jesus. We meditate on His Name because He is the Son of God. This is the essential faith of Christianity, which separates us from all other religions, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Only-begotten Son of God. \nMany heresies unfolded because of the lack of understanding of this one statement. One example of this is the heresy of Arius, who was defeated by the Holy Spirit working through the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria, St. Athanasius, who wrote many books concerning the reality that the Lord Jesus Christ was indeed the Son of God. One of St. Athanasius’s most famous pieces was titled On the Incarnation. If we do not believe that He is the Only-begotten Son of God, equal and consubstantial with the Father, then we have missed the act of redemption on the Cross. The Pharisees sought to kill Him because He identified Himself as the Son of God, but we, who are His children, must embrace Him, confessing Him to be the Son of God.\nAfter we have believed in Him, confessing Him to be the Son of God, we then turn our eyes to the Cross, for it was there that we received redemption. If Christ were not the Son of God, then His death on the Cross would have been of no use to us, even if the person crucified had been an angel of heaven. Christ, the Son of God, descended from heaven, took our form, and lived among us. He fulfilled all the sayings of the prophets and lived the perfect life according to the Law. Our Lord Jesus Christ, being perfect, without the original sin of Adam, was the only One who could sacrifice Himself upon the wood of the Cross to redeem man from the bondage of sin, opening the gates of Paradise for us all.\n\"Both from the confession of the evil spirits and from the daily witness of His works, it is manifest, then, and let none presume to doubt it, that the Savior has raised His own body, and that He is very Son of God, having His being from God as from a Father, Whose Word and Wisdom and Whose Power He is. He it is Who in these latter days assumed a body for the salvation of us all, and taught the world concerning the Father. It is He Who has destroyed death and freely graced us all with incorruption through the promise of the resurrection, having raised His own body as its first-fruits, and displayed it by the sign of the cross as the monument to His victory over death and its corruption\" (St. Athanasius).\n\n***\"In the accepted time, hear me, My Lord Jesus Christ, help me.\"***\nThis verse is also very beautiful, showing the rising of the soul and its progression in strength, yearning more for the heavenly things. Whenever we pray these few words, asking God to hear us in the accepted time, we show how we have united our minds with our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\"I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father! The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me. And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them\" (John 17:20-26).\nThese wonderful words were spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ to the Father, in His prayer before His death. These Holy, life-giving words show that our Lord has truly changed us in the prayer of the Holy Psalmody. We progress from asking for our physical needs, to abiding in the presence of God, being one with Him since it was the Son who asked that this may be done. We can see this because when we pray asking God to hear us in the accepted time, we are asking that His Will be done. We realize that it is not with our limited minds that we may endure, but we place all our thoughts before His Throne, believing and trusting in Him, knowing He is the Pantocrator. Our prayer has become like that which was spoken by our Lord to His Father, asking only of the things of heaven. We no longer care nor worry about early things, but instead, we take to heart that Our Lord Jesus Christ has already prayed on our behalf. We now wait, asking God to attend to all our needs (spiritual and physical) in the right and appropriate time.\n\n***\"Disperse away from me, all of the devils, My Lord Jesus Christ, help me.\"***\nAs mentioned earlier, because of the envy of the devil, and our persistence to detach ourselves from him, rebuking his ways, he will come with a whole army of devils to try to lure us away from the love of God. St. Paul makes reference to this saying,\n\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" (Ephesians 6:12)\nWe have the armies of Hades attacking us now, seeking vehemently to rip our souls from the presence of God, but the Lord has not left us unarmed against these demonic powers. The first evidence of this is the Cross.\n\"Dear beloved, He defeated the whole world as we see. He did not conquer it by military powers but by the ignorance of the cross. All spirits surrendered to Him when His body was raised on the Cross.\" (St. Augustine)\nWhenever we cross ourselves, we burn the devils, forcing them to retreat from our presence. St. Paul also alludes to the power of the Cross.\n\"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.\" (1 Corinthians 1:18)\nEach time we sign ourselves with the Cross, confessing the Holy Trinity, we ward off those who attempt to revolt against us. We remind those devils, who once ruled over us in the days of slavery, that we belong to the Almighty King, the God who delivered us from their wicked ways. We remind them that it is through the Cross that Jesus descended into Hades (Ephesians 4:8-10), and as He went to save the souls of the righteous who were sitting in darkness, He crushed all the demonic powers because they could not behold His awesome and powerful glory.\n\"Demons, so far from cheating any more by illusions and prophecies and magic arts—if they so much as dare to make the attempt—are put to shame by the sign of the cross.\" (St. Athanasius)\nThe second way to overcome the devil, is like the first. King David writes,\n\"All nations surrounded me, But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. They surrounded me, Yes, they surrounded me; But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. They surrounded me like bees; They were quenched like a fire of thorns; For in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. You pushed me violently, that I might fall, But the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation.\" (Psalm 118 10:14)\nWe have defeated the devil through the chanting of this hymn! We have seen that the \"name of the Lord will destroy our enemies.\" By praising and meditating on His name throughout the Holy Psalmody and especially in the Sunday Psali for Jesus, we are not only raised, but we destroy the devil as we sing His name. Now if the Name of Jesus terrifies and conquers the devil, how much more will the presence of God destroy him?"
