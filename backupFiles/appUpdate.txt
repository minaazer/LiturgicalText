Feasible, and pretty common for content‑heavy apps. The complexity is moderate if you keep it to “static JSON + manifest + cache,” and higher if you add a multi‑user editing portal with validation, workflows, and permissions.

Here’s a practical approach:

1) Hosting + versioning

Store JSON files on an object store / static server. On Lightsail, you can run an Nginx static server, or simpler: use S3 + CloudFront (less ops).
Add a manifest.json that lists each file, its version/hash, and last updated time.
App startup flow: download manifest → compare to cached manifest → fetch only changed files → update cache → use cache when offline.
2) Caching on device

Cache JSONs in the filesystem (e.g., expo-file-system or React Native FS) rather than AsyncStorage for large files.
Keep a small “index” in AsyncStorage for the manifest + versions.
3) Offline behavior

If network fails, load from cache.
If cache missing on first run, show a “download required” screen.
4) Editing portal

Easiest: headless CMS (Strapi, Directus, Sanity).
Pros: auth, versioning, UI, validation.
Cons: you’ll need to map content to your JSON format or build a transform layer.
Alternative: Git‑based workflow (Netlify CMS / Decap) + CI that builds JSON and deploys to the server.
If you need a custom editor for your table schema, that’s a larger effort (schema‑driven UI + validation + preview + approvals).
5) Validation

Add JSON schema validation server‑side before publishing.
App should reject invalid payloads and fall back to cached version.
Complexity estimate

Static host + manifest + caching: low to medium (a few days).
CMS + user editing + approvals + validation: medium to high (weeks, depending on UI and workflows).
If you want, I can draft:

A manifest format and app‑side loader skeleton.
A minimal backend plan on Lightsail.
A recommendation between CMS vs Git workflow based on your needs.
To scope this correctly, can you tell me:

Rough number/size of JSON files?
Do you need user roles/approvals?
Is the JSON schema stable, or do you expect frequent structure changes?
